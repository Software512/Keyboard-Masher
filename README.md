# Keyboard Masher
Express your anger, without destroying your keyboard or accidentally pressing keyboard shortcuts. Keyboard masher is a browser extension that simulates quickly mashing keyboard buttons by typing random characters into a textbox. To use it, right-click on a textbox, and click the “Mash Keyboard” button in the context menu. You can stop it by clicking anywhere on the webpage or pressing any key on the keyboard.
