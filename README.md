# Keyboard Masher
Express your anger, without destroying your keyboard or accidentally pressing keyboard shortcuts. This extension simulates quickly mashing keyboard buttons by typing random characters into a textbox. To use it, right-click on a textbox, and click the “Mash Keyboard” button in the context menu. You can stop it by clicking anywhere on the webpage or pressing any key on the keyboard.

Currently only available for Chromium-based browsers.
